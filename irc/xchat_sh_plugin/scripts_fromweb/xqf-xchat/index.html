<p align="left"><font size="4">Based on the excellent mIRC
script,</font> <a href="http://www.planetquake.com/gs2m/"><font
size="4">Gamespy2mIRC</font></a><font size="4">. Thanks to Peter
Reinhold, the author of the GSM script, for the original idea and
his blessing on my porting the script to Linux-based
software!</font></p>

<p align="left"><font color="#DC0E46" size="5">Intro</font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="4">Welcome to the XQF -&gt; XChat
Perl script web page for Linux XQF and XChat. This script links the
programs XQF, XChat and Licq (not required). When you start a game with XQF,
this script notifies other chat channel users that you are playing a game
and (optionally) changes your nick to reflect your gaming status.  Also,
your Licq status can be changed (n/a, occupied, etc) and the autoresponse
message will be changed to the stats of the server you are using. When
gaming, other users in the room can request your gaming stats from the
script. What mod you are playing, the server IP# and the elasped time since
you started playing the game are available with a single request from other
IRC channel chatters.  When you return from gaming, you type a command and
your nick is changed back, Licq is reset and other channel users are notified
of your return.</font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="4">Also, XQF -&gt; XChat now has an optional
feature of monitoring IRC channel traffic for a special command followed by
a dotted-quad IP number.  The script will then ping the IP number and
report back to the channel the latency from your computer to that server.
This is a nice feature for a group of people to easily find a public server
that is usable by everyone because one person can post an IP number and the
rest of the channel users will ping it automatically.</font></p>

<p align="left"><font color="#DC0E46" size="5">
Requirements</font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="4">This script requires the IRC client</font>
<a href="http://www.xchat.org"><font size="4"> XChat</font></a><font
size="4">, compiled with Perl scripting support and the game browser</font>
<a href= "http://www.linuxgames.com/xqf/"><font size="4">
XQF</font></a><font size="4">, version 0.9.5 or newer.  For optional ICQ
integration, <a href= "http://www.licq.com"><font size="4">
Licq</font></a><font size="4"> is required.</font></p>

<p align="left"><font color="#DC0E46" size="5">
Installation</font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="4">First, in XQF, you have to turn on
LaunchInfo.txt support via Preferences / Appearance. Then, just
drop the script into .xchat/ in your home directory.</font></p>

<p align="left"><font color="#DC0E46" size="5">Usage</font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="4">Start XChat, and join the channels
you wish. When you start a game with XQF, the script will
automatically detect you have started gaming and will perform
it's actions. When you are done gaming, make sure to type
"/return" in a XChat window to tell the script you have
returned.</font></p>

<p align="left"><font color="#DC0E46" size="5">
Customization</font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="4">While the script was made to work without
user modifications, customization of notification messages is possible and
various script features can be enabled or disabled to suit the user.
The script is fairly well documented, just load it into your favorite
editor and go at it.</font></p>

Revision History</font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="4">06/28/03 - Changed a feature. Instead of
"quiet channels" the script now uses "active channels".  So instead of
adding channels that you don't wish XQF -&gt; XChat to monitor, you add the
channels that it _will_ monitor. The script still defaults to using all
open channels and you need to edit the script to add to the active channels
list.</font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="4"> A new command was added to ping servers.
It allows someone in a channel to post the command plus a dotted-quad IP
number and the script will automatically ping that server and post the
results back to the channel. This allows a group of people to quickly and
easily find a suitable public server with a minimal amount of cut and
pasting of IP numbers. You need to edit the script to enable this feature.
Thanks to NiTrO for another idea! (version 0.70) </font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="4">10/02/02 - Added new feature!  Now you can
add "quiet channels" to a list by editing the script. These channels
will not receive the usual script gaming messages. Read the script
for more instructions on how to use this. Thanks to NiTrO for the
idea! (version 0.60) </font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="4">9/02/02 - Fixed some problems causing server
error messages and away message problems.  Thanks to Pol for the heads-up.
(version 0.56) </font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="4">7/07/02 - Added rudimentary online help via
the command /xqf-xchathelp. Updated the home page link in the script
to the new one. (version 0.55) </font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="4">12/09/01 - Licq detection was starting to
get dodgy again, so I changed the regular expression to be less strict.
Ran the script through perltidy. Now including this webpage
in the package tarball. (version 0.54) </font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="4">8/03/01 - Ludwig Nussel sent in a patch to
fix a bug where the XChat user would get a error message if someone
requested server information and you never cycled the script.  Thanks
Ludwig!  (version 0.53) </font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="4">7/25/01 - Thanks to Ludwig Nussel, XQF -&gt;
XChat now has some nice new features and bug fixes. Licq can be
started at any time now (before Licq had to be running at script
initialization for any Licq support).  You can choose what Licq
status you wish the script to use, like N/A, Occupied, Away, etc. (edit the
script for this) As an appeasement to the mIRC crowd, the XChat
command "/wallchan" can be used for various notifications. Finally,
some bug fixes to make XQF -&gt; XChat work correctly with XChat 1.8.1.
Thanks Ludwig!  (version 0.52) 
</font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="4">6/15/01 - Now XQF -&gt; XChat can set
your /away status. &nbsp; Made it easy to enable/disable many features
of the script by setting variables in one central location to 1 or 0.
&nbsp; Read the script for more information on this and customize as
you wish. &nbsp; Made the default feature selection less annoying for
mIRC users.  (version 0.51)
</font></p>
	
<p align="left"><font size="4">3/16/01 - Continued making XQF -&gt; XChat a
good Perl-script neighbor by using the Perl packaging system.  &nbsp; Also
added a flag to defeat the "gaming" nick change. &nbsp;  For now, you 
will have to edit the script to set this. (version 0.50)
</font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="4">2/12/01 - Updated XQF -&gt; XChat to
work better with other XChat Perl scripts that are running concurrently
with this script. (version 0.43)
</font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="4">12/19/00 - Licq detection was proving erratic
causing the script to disable Licq support erroneously or just plain hang.
I've changed the code for this to something that will (hopefully) work better.
(version 0.41)
</font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="4">12/14/00 - Licq support added!  XQF -&gt; XChat
can now optionally update your Licq away message with the stats of the game
server your are using. (version 0.40) 
</font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="4">11/23/00 - Initial public release (version 0.30)
</font></p>
