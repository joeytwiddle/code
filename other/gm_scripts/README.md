This folder contains all my favourite userscripts, including scripts written by me, scripts written by others, and scripts I have modified.

If you want to browse or install these scripts quickly, you can try browsing the "official" release page: http://neuralyte.org/~joey/gm_scripts/joeys_userscripts_and_bookmarklets_overview.html

That page also lets you load the scripts as bookmarklets instead of userscripts.  (I guess on modern secure websites, only the Static Bookmarklets will load properly.)

You can also find a selection of them online at [OpenUserJS](https://openuserjs.org/users/joeytwiddle/scripts) or on [GreasyFork](https://greasyfork.org/en/users/8615-joeytwiddle).

Finally, this is where they are kept on [Github](https://github.com/joeytwiddle/code/tree/master/other/gm_scripts).  You can provide feedback or pull requests here.
