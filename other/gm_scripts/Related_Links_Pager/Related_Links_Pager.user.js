// Google redirection can block #siblings from being carried to the target page.  If that happens, this script may help: http://userscripts.org/scripts/show/121261#Straight_Google

// DONE: Using the pager always sets the siblings packet in the target URL, even if passPacketByGM is enabled!  Fix that.
// FIXED: Still problems with the pager not working when passPacketByGM is enabled.  For some reason the pager shows us focused on the wrong link in the list!  (Was browsing vim.org, URLs_Need_Titles was adding #s to the title but not the links.)  Also, sometimes the old packet was getting cleared and a new one was not loading when clicking pager clicks.
// DONE: We want RLP to run on github, for lists of external links, just not for links to local pages (or it can always run if passPacketByGM!).  Same could be said for twitter, facebook, etc.
// CONSIDER: When following same-domain links, Chrome could opt to use GM_set/get or localStorage, rather than the messy #siblings packet.

// TODO: RLP does not fire for sites which use HTML5 History API to "change" page.  We could detect use of push/replaceState, and rebuild the pager after a timeout or event.

// BUG: Breaks digitalocean community tutorials, when reached via google search.

// == CHANGELOG ==
// 2019-12-10 Remove global option 'leaveHashUrlsAlone' - enable dynamically instead
// 2012-10-27 Added passPacketByGM for all browsers except Chrome.
// 2012-10-21 Fixes for Google search results link rewriting war!
// 2012-10-08 Fixed inefficiencies in getXPath which could cause lockups.
// 2012-03-22 Added highlighting and further heuristics.
// 2012-02-07 Bugfixes and more heuristics.
// 2012-01-30 Fixed repeat rewrite bug by checking for &sib as well as #sib.
// 2012-01-28 Fixed close button positioning in Firefox.
// 2012-01-28 Restricted related links to those with the same CSS class.
//       BUG: We still group unrelated (indistinguishable) links on Wikipedia!
// 2012-01-28 Blacklisted some buggy situations.


// == NOTES ==

// FIXED: On huge pages this used to run very slowly, locking up Firefox.
// This was due to an inefficient for loop in getXPath.
// DONE: This can be easily fixed, since we don't actually use the numbers!

// You can avoid this script either by clicking a link before it runs or by
// activating the desired link with the keyboard instead of the mouse.

// TODO: The # method seems to work but could present a BUG on some sites.  It
// is sometimes needed but it's horrible.  Use alternatives where possible.  In
// Chrome that could be localStorage *if* the followed sibling is on the same
// domain.  In Firefox Greasemonkey we can use GM_set/getValue().

// TODO: Pager can only go sideways.  It could also offer ability to go "up"
// to the page that contained all the links in the current group.

// BUG: Does not work through redirects.

// CONSIDER: Would it be better to use a normal CGI '&' instead of '#' ?
// Should we compress the data to survive through more webservers?

// TODO: Do not load pager if it is redundant (i.e. if we can already see the
// sibling links on the current page!).

// DONE: removeRedirection only runs on links originally in the page, not
// those added later, e.g. by Ajax when refining a Google search.  This may be
// the cause of some issues.  (Google says "This url is too long.")

// FIXED: Now we are passing ,1 to mark the "current" page, but this is
// being passed into the siblings package.  The package needs to be rebuilt and
// altered!  That was a fairly rare case: redirected to a new domain but
// siblings retained!

// BUG TODO: With forceTravel=true, submitting an answer on StackOverflow, we
// get a warning message that we are about to leave the current page!  (In fact
// is was fine for me to accept the warning and the post happened ok, but still
// hardly tidy!)
//
// Recommend: Default to forceTravel=false, and override with heuristics only
// for Google search!  So it works gently for all users, never causing
// problems, but sometimes failing(being invisibly overriden - gah!).  Enable
// it for personal use, as other powerusers might do.
//
// Another place our script is overzealous is on StackOverflow, when clicking
// to expand a post, AJAX works just fine, but forceTravel sends us to a
// different page regardless!  Solution: don't click on the link, click on the
// div.
//
// I can't see any way how forceTravel could detect whether the user wants it
// or not.  Well, the user wants it only if clicking would take them to a new
// page.  Could we perhaps catch the page change event and if it happened
// immediately after a click, ensure the target URL has siblings packet.  I'm
// not sure JS has the power to do that through onbeforeunload.
//
// Perhaps we should go for a medium option - remove .onclick and unregister
// any event handlers (we can't do that!).  Sites *should* fall back to their
// non-JS method.
//
// Oh well we already are removing onmousedown, perhaps we should do click and
// mouseup also, but make them all optional.

// TODO: Appending # data breaks Twitter.  @exclude is not the solution.  We
// should just not append to links who land on twitter (from in or out), whilst
// links leaving Twitter should be fine!

// TODO: Despite setting forceTravel, Google search results pages sometimes
// send us to their own click-tracking URL which redirects us to the target
// page but loses our siblings packet.  One solution to this might be to
// replace the link in the page with our own A element, so that clicking it
// will not fire directly linked events.  (It could still however trigger
// events attached to a parent.  Is it possible to override/prevent them with
// an event listener we add later?)
